An AI plant agent, also known as a botanical agent, is an AI-powered system that autonomously monitors and optimizes plant growth. It is an intelligent agent that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and act to achieve specific goals, such as maximizing crop yield or maintaining the health of a garden, without constant human intervention.
